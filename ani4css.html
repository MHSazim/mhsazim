    Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and
    coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
</p>
<p>Various educators teach rules governing the length of paragra
    phs. They may say that a paragraph should be 100 to 200 words
     long, or be no more than five or six sentences. But a good 
     paragraph should not be measured in characters,
     words, or sentences.The true measure of your paragraphs should be ideas.</p>
